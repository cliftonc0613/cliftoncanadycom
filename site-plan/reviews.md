- **Review:** "Clifton and his team at CT WEB DESIGN SHOP included Splendid Services in every aspect of the design process. The communication was important in making this project a success. I am very satisfied in their efforts  start to finish. Today Splendid Services' website launched and it is the most professional display of a website design by far. I definitely recommend anyone seeking to start a website or add to an already up and running website to contact CT WEB DESIGN SHOP."

- **Review:** "Clifton was referred to me via a friend that was helping me re-design my logo. Clifton built me a bare bones website, as I had requested. I wanted to complete it myself. However, he set-up hosting, directed several domains over to the new site and more! He has always been available for questions that I had and has always remained patient with me. I look forward to using Clifton in the future and referring business to him."
